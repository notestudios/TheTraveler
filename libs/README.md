# Third-party libraries
This repo requires, until now, two third-party libraries:
   - [Game Jolt API for Java](https://github.com/ashleygwinnell/Game-Jolt-Java-Game-API) | [JAR](https://github.com/ashleygwinnell/Game-Jolt-Java-Game-API/blob/master/GJAPI.jar?raw=true)
   - [Discord RPC for Java](https://github.com/Vatuu/discord-rpc) | [JAR](https://github.com/Vatuu/discord-rpc/releases/download/1.6.2/discord-rpc.jar) <br><br>
   
   Credits to [ashleygwinnell](https://github.com/ashleygwinnell/) for the Java Game Jolt API and [Vatuu](https://github.com/Vatuu) for the Java Discord RPC.

   All the required libraries are included in the `pom.xml`, in the root of the project.
