## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
 The Traveler GitHub Repository has been moved to the **Note Studios** organization. Altough the project is still maintained by me, 
It has been moved to make the Note Studios in-game logo and face make more sense, so I created this organization and moved the repo here.
Even so, you can still use the repo in my account. It has just the `main`(stable) branch, meaning it's stable commits. I am just a single person, 
so feel free to [contribute to the project](#Contributing) if you want!
